# AStarPathfinding
 
Most of our actual algorithmic code is within Assets Folder with our Scripts, within AStar.cs

We utilized Unity as the visualizer for our program, as anywhere where the mouse is clicked and held will determine what path is needed to be calculated from the red box (which counts as the starting node).

We used 2022.1.13f1 version of Unity to build our project.
